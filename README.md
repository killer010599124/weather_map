 
This is a demonstration dashboard using the Visual Crossing
Weather API <link - https://www.visualcrossing.com/weather-api/>
combined with the Mapbox mapping API <link - https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-js>
using React.  The dashboard draws a world
map showing the current weather conditions for major cities around the
globe.  The user can interactively add additional
locations to the map to explore the weather conditions anywhere on the globe.  These additional locations will be saved in a
cookie so that the user can return to their customized map at any time.


 


When the user selects a location, in addition to the current
weather conditions, he or she can elect to see a 3-day forecast or link to
standard Visual Crossing dashboards for detailed forecast, detailed history, or
typical weather conditions for that location. 
This functionality allows the user to manage multiple locations in an interactive,
high-level, map-based view while giving the ability to easily reach through to
find detailed data anytime that it is needed.


 


Below is a video showing the dashboard in action.
